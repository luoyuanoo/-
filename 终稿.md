| Alongside the revolutions in humanity, we have   also seen evolutions in digitalisation. Digital humanity did not just arrive   overnight; it has been emerging over the last seventy years. Many people a   decade ago, for example, were talking about WEB 2.0, the second-generation   internet. Having worked with technology throughout my life, I actually think   we are in the fourth evolution in technology. Digital 4.0 if you prefer.   Therefore, alongside our understanding of humanity living through digital   transformation, it is important to understand the origins and emergence of   how that digital transformation has developed. | 随着人类社会的进步，我们也见证了数字化的发展。人类社会数字化不是突然出现的，它在过去的七十年里一直处于兴起状态中。例如，十年前，许多人都在谈论第二代互联网（WEB2.0）。科技贯穿于我们的一生，我认为我们实际上正处于科技的第四次变革中。如果你愿意，可以将它称为数字4.0。因此,随着我们通过数字化转换对人类生活的理解加深,了解数字转换如何发着的起源和出现也很重要。 |

| The origins of the WEB start with the beginnings   of building computers. I’m not going to linger on this too much as hopefully   you’ve seen The Imitation Game with Benedict Cumberbatch in the role of Alan   Turing solving the Enigma Code during the Second World War (although the   Polish claim to have solved the code a decade earlier). Wars often stimulate   progress. Just look at aircraft design and development in the first and   second world wars, and how the Second World War brought about the development   of computing. | 网络的起源始于计算机建立的起点。我不会对此赘述得太多，希望你已经看过了由本尼迪克特·康伯巴奇主演的《模仿游戏》，电影主要讲述了艾伦·图灵协助盟军破译德国密码系统“英格玛”，从而扭转二战战局的经历。（虽然波兰声称他们已经在十多年前就破译了该代码）。战争促进社会变革。第一次和第二次世界大战中飞机的设计和发展，以及第二次世界大战如何促进计算机的发展。 |
| As I mentioned earlier, ENIAC was the world’s   first general- purpose electronic computer. After building ENIAC at the   University of Pennsylvania, J.Presper Eckert and John Mauchly, the inventors,   formed EMCC, the first commercial computer company, to build new computer   designs for commercial and military applications. The company was initially   called the Electronic Control Company, but the name had changed to   Eckert–Mauchly Computer Corporation by the time it launched. Eventually,   their firm offered the UNIVersal Automatic Computer (UNIVAC), which was the   computer system used by NASA in the 1960s to get a man on the Moon. Bearing   in mind Moore’s Law which states that computer power doubles every year   whilst cost halves, those systems were pretty basic. In fact, you have more   compute power in your Apple watch today than was carried in the Apollo moon   shots, which is why we’re now saying that the colonisation of Mars is a real   possibility. | 正如我上文提及的，埃尼阿克（ENIAC）是世界上第一台通用电子计算机。在埃尼阿克诞生于美国宾夕法尼亚大学后，它的发明人普雷斯特·艾克特和约翰·莫克利创立了第一家商用计算机公司——艾克特莫克利计算机公司，该公司主要为商业和军事应用开发新的计算机设计。该公司最初被称为“电子控制公司”，但在发布时更名为“艾克特莫克利计算机公司”。最终，该公司提供的通用电子计算机（UNIVAC）是美国国家航空航天局（NASA）在20世纪60年代使用的计算机系统，主要用于登月计划。考虑到摩尔定律规定计算机性能每年翻倍,而成本减半,因此这些系统都是相当基础的。事实上,今天你的苹果手表上的计算能力比当初拍摄阿波罗登月照的计算机的能力更强,这就是为什么我们现在说火星殖民是一个真实存在的可能性。 |
| It was during this period that computer power in   private companies began to take off, with a spray of other firms entering the   fray. IBM became the biggest of these firms, and the company to buy from,   having purchased the Series 360 instruction set from an incredible inventor   and founder of Wang Lab, Dr. An Wang. By the 1980s, the comment was that   nobody ever got fired for buying IBM, and the result was that a lot of its   competitors— Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC), Wang, International Computers   Limited (ICL), Burroughs and Sperry—all fell by the wayside by the end of the   decade. A remarkable achievement for a firm whose president originally   dismissed computing as limited to a worldwide market of just five systems. | 正是在这个时期，私人公司的计算机性能开始迅速提升，其他公司纷纷加入这场战争。美国国际商用机器公司（IBM）是其中最大的公司，并从一个了不起的发明家——王安实验室的创始人——王安博士那里购买了360系列指令集。在20世纪80年代，人们的评论是，没有人会因为购买了美国国际商用机器公司的产品而被解雇，结果反而是美国国际商用机器公司的许多竞争对手——美国数字设备公司（DEC），王安，国际电脑有限公司（ICL），巴勒斯和斯佩里——到80年代末都相继失败。对于一家公司来说,它的总裁最初将计算机视为仅有五个计算机系统的全球市场,本身就是一项了不起的成就。 |
| However, IBM did initially dismiss another rising   technology as irrelevant—the personal computer (PC) operating system—even   though it owned that space as the first commercial PC manufacturer. In fact,   a little- known fact is that it was Bill Gates’ mother Mary who made   Microsoft what it is today. | 然而，美国国际商用机器公司最初还是将另一项新兴技术视为无关紧要的——个人电脑（PC）操作系统——尽管它拥有作为第一家商用个人电脑制造商的制作空间。一个鲜为人知的事实，是比尔·盖茨的母亲玛丽让微软成为了今天的样子。玛丽·盖茨是是第一洲际银行公司的首名女性主管，后来被任命为全国联合劝募协会的董事会成员。1983年，她成为全国联合劝募协会执行理事会的首名女性主席。她任职于国家委员会执行委员会期间，在关键时刻帮助了她儿子的公司。这是因为，在1980年，她与委员会成员约翰·欧普谈论过她儿子的公司。欧普是美国国际商用机器公司的董事长，玛丽告诉他，她儿子的公司能够帮助美国国际商用机器公司开发新业务。几周后，美国国际商用机器公司抓住机会聘请微软为其第一台个人电脑开发操作系统。美国国际商用机器公司个人电脑的成功让微软最终成为全球最大的软件公司。结局总是那么有趣。 |
| Mary Gates was one of the first women to serve as   a director of a bank, the First Interstate Bank, and was later appointed to   the board of the United Way of America. In 1983, she became the first woman   to lead it. Her tenure on the national board’s executive committee helped her   son’s company at a crucial time. This is because, in 1980, she discussed her   son’s company with John Opel, a fellow committee member. Opel was the   chairman of IBM, and Mary told him that her son’s firm might be able to help   the new business IBM was developing. A few weeks later, IBM took a chance by   hiring Microsoft to develop an operating system for its first personal   computer. The success of the IBM PC gave Microsoft a lift that eventually   made it the world’s largest software company. Funny how things turn out. |                                                              |
| Another giant of technology at the time, who also   dismissed the PC, was Ken Olsen, founder of DEC. He believed that “there is   no reason anyone would want a computer in their home”. This is the same guy   who dismissed the operating system Unix as snake oil, even though, back then   in the 1980s, he was running one of the largest computer companies. No wonder   his firm went by the wayside. Unsurprisingly, Olsen was forced out of DEC in 1992   and the firm was acquired by Compaq in 1998. | 当时的另一个技术巨头，美国数字设备公司的创始人肯·奥尔森也对个人电脑不削一顾。他认为“我们没有理由认为人们会需要家用电脑。”他也将可供多人同时使用的操作系统Unix视为狗皮膏药。尽管在20世纪80年代，他正经营一家最大的计算机公司。难怪他的公司最终会倒闭。不出所料，奥尔森于1992年被迫退出美国数字设备公司，该公司于1998年被康柏公司收购。 |
| Around the same time, several leading figures   were playing their part in developing the modern internet, including Ivan   Sutherland and Robert Taylor’s work on the Advanced Research Projects Agency   Network (ARPANET), and Kevin Kelly’s work on the Well that led to the   founding of Wired magazine. However, for me, the standout figure has to be   Sir Tim Berners-Lee. | 大概在同一时间，几位领先人物在开发现代互联网方面发挥了重要作用，包括伊凡·苏泽兰和罗伯特·泰勒在美国高级研究计划署网（ARPANET）的工作，以及凯文·凯利早前的工作促使了他建立的《连线》杂志。然而，在我看来，最杰出的人物必须是蒂姆·伯纳斯·李。 |
| Berners-Lee is viewed by many as the founding   father of the modern internet due to his development of the foundations that   we use today: HTML, URLs and HTTP. | 伯纳斯·李被许多人视为现代互联网的创始人，因为他开发了我们今天所使用网络的基础：超文本标记语言（HTML）、统一资源定位符（URLs）和超文本传输协议（HTTP）。 |
| HyperText Markup Language (HTML): the mark-up   (formatting) language for the web | 超文本标记语言（HTML）：构成网页的标记（格式）语言           |
| Uniform Resource Identifier (URI): a kind of   “address” that is unique and used to identify each resource on the web, also   commonly called a URL | 统一资源标识符（URI）：一种“地址”，是一个用于标识某一互联网资源名称的字符串，通常也称为URL |
| Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP): allows for   the retrieval of linked resources from across the web | 超文本传输协议（HTTP）：允许从整个网络检索链接的资源         |
| He proposed these three concepts in an October 1990   research paper at CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research, near   Geneva, where he had been working since 1980. The 1990 paper was an extension   of what many consider the founding paper of today’s internet, “Information   Management: A Proposal”, which had been presented to CERN in March 1989.   Believe it or not, his initial proposal was not immediately accepted. In   fact, his boss at the time, Mike Sendall, wrote the words “vague but   exciting” on the cover. The WEB was never an official CERN project but   Sendall managed to give Berners-Lee time to work on it, and that led to the   breakthrough in 1990. | 伯纳斯·李自1980年以来，一直在位于日内瓦的欧洲原子核研究会（CERN）工作，并在1990年10月的一篇研究论文中提出了这三个概念。1990年的这篇论文被许多人认为是1989年3月提交给欧洲原子核研究会的当今互联网创始文件“信息管理：一项提案”的延伸。无论你相信与否，他的初步提案并没有被立即接受。事实是，他当时的上司迈克·森德尔在封面上写下了“含糊但令人兴奋”的字样。互联网从未成为欧洲原子核研究会的官方研究项目，但森德尔设法让伯纳斯·李对互联网进行研究，这就促成了1990年的突破。 |
| So the first generation of the modern internet   was born in 1990, some forty-five years after the birth of computing. Since   then, each generation of the internet has lasted about ten years. In the 2000s,   there was WEB 2.0. Now we are developing WEB 3.0, the Internet of Value.   Soon, we will be entering the era of the Internet of Things, WEB 4.0. Then,   in the 2030s, we will be immersed in the Semantic Web, web 5.0. | 因此，第一代现代互联网诞生于1990年，在计算机诞生约四十五年后。从那以后，每一代互联网都持续了大约十年。在21世纪初，有了第二代互联网（WEB2.0）。现在我们正在开发第三代互联网（WEB3.0），即价值互联网。很快，我们将进入第四代互联网——物联网时代（WEB4.0）。然后，在21世纪30年代，我们将沉浸在第五代互联网，语义互联网（Web5.0）中。 |
| **WEB** **1****.****0****: THE NETWORK BEGINS**              | **WEB****1****.****0****：互联网的开端**                     |
| As mentioned, almost half a century of   developments in technology led to the launch of the WEB as we know it today,   following Tim Berners-Lee’s paper detailing HTML and URLs. This was in 1990   and, subsequently, the internet morphs almost every decade This makes our   decade, the 2010s, the era of WEB 3.0 and the building of the Internet of   Value which, for those of you who read my last book, I call the “ValueWeb”.   But let’s go back to the 1990s and see what happened then. | 正如前面所提到的，随着蒂姆•伯纳斯•李提出了超文本标记语言（HTML），统一资源定位符（URLs），近半个世纪的技术发展促进了我们今天所知的互联网的发展。在1990年后，互联网几乎每十年变革一次。21世纪的第一个十年是我们的十年，对于那些阅读过我上一本书的人都知道我将第三代互联网即价值互联网的建设，称之为“价值网”。但让我们回到20世纪90年代，看看当时发生了什么。 |
| The first Website was launched by Tim Berners-Lee   on 6 August 1991 and was pretty basic, as were most of the early Websites.   Most of these sites were launched by academic and research firms, and were   there to collate information. For instance, Wired, Bloomberg and the Internet   Movie Database (IMDb) launched Websites in 1993, and more soon followed.   While these Websites mainly provided information, some were more visual than   others but none were interactive. | 第一个网站是由蒂姆•伯纳斯•李于1991年8月6日建立的，并且与大多数早期网站一样都是很基础的网站。这些大多数网站是由学术和研究公司建立的，主要用于整理信息。例如，《连线》、彭博社和互联网电影数据库（IMDb）在1993年推出了网站，并且其他机构也很快效仿。虽然这些网站主要提供信息，但有些网站比其他网站更具视觉效果，但没有一个是互动性的网站。 |
| Interactivity didn’t really start until   pornographers saw the potential of the internet. As with any new technology,   sex and pornography are the catalysts that drive early adoption. For example,   Event Horizons BBS was grossing more than $3.2 million dollars a year by 1993.   Jim Maxey, who ran Event Horizons, employed ten people simply to scan   photographs, format them and put them online for download. They didn’t do any   marketing as such; news simply got around through word of mouse. Consequently,   a whole raft of sites launched that led to commerce online. | 直到色情作品的制作者看到了互联网的潜力，通过网络的互动才真正开始。与任何新技术一样，性和色情文学是早期促进计划产生的催化剂。例如，到1993年，视界论坛每年的收入超过320万美元。运行视界的主要负责人吉姆·麦克西雇佣了10个人，只让他们扫描照片，调整格式并将它们放到网上用于下载。他们没有采取任何营销手段；消息只是通过点击鼠标来传播。因此，大量网站被建立，从而实现了在线商务。 |
| In other words, the drive of pornography led to   online commerce, with the first payments being taken through credit card   forms online. The first commercial Website that took credit card payments was   books.com. The books.com Website was owned by Book Stacks Ltd, a U.S. bookshop   that had been running a bulletin board in the 1980s and then moved online in 1992,   three years before Amazon launched. It was eventually acquired by Barnes   & Noble. | 换句话说，色情文学的驱动力促进了在线商务的出现。第一笔付款通过网上信用卡进行。第一个使用信用卡付款的商业网站是博来网。博来网网站属于书库有限公司，书库有限公司是一家美国书店，在20世纪80年代发布了一个电子公告栏，并于1992年上线，比亚马逊的推出早了三年。它最终被巴诺公司收购。 |
| Another notable online first took place on 11   August 1994 when the first secure, commercial online payment was taken by   American retailer NetMarket. This transaction opened the door to the era of   internet commerce. With the launch of Amazon in 1995, as did eBay, other   modern standards like Google (1998), PayPal (1999, originally as x.com) and   Alibaba (1999) quickly followed. Within just twenty years, by 2014, online   retail commerce was worth £100 billion a year in the United Kingdom alone. | 另一个值得注意的网上交易事件发生于1994年8月11日，美国零售商网上市场进行了第一次安全的商业在线支付。这笔交易打开了通往互联网商业时代的大门。随着1995年亚马逊的推出，与易趣一样，谷歌（1998年），贝宝（1999年，最初为名为x.com）和阿里巴巴（1999年）等其他现代标准的网上支付方式也随之而来。到2014年，在这短短的二十年里，仅在英国，在线零售商业每年的价值就达到1000亿英镑。 |
| This was the decade of WEB 1.0: the evolution of   the first Website into thousands of sites delivering everything from   infomercials to easy commerce. It was the time of Netscape and AOL, of   dial-up lines and modems. | 这是第一代互联网（WEB1.0）的十年：从一个网站发展到数千个网站，提供从商业信息广告到简单商务的各种服务。那是网景和美国在线（AOL）的时代，也是固定电话和电话线提供网络访问的时代。 |
| The key features of this first-generation   internet were that it was highly controlled and structured. Businesses ran   the internet. Websites were offered by business to consumers (B2C), and everything   was about B2C and business to business (B2B). Following information services,   commerce enabled the WEB to really take off. The first payment services were   just credit card forms, as mentioned, but soon companies realised that form   filling was onerous and a barrier to commerce, so firms dedicated solely to   payments launched. | 第一代互联网的主要特点是高度控制和结构化。企业运行依靠互联网。网站由企业向消费者提供，网站上的一切都是关于消费者对企业和企业对企业（B2B）。随着信息服务的发展，商业使网络得到了真正的快速发展。如前面所述，第一种支付服务只是采用信用卡形式，但很快，公司意识到填写表单是一项繁重的工作，也是商业的一个障碍，因此，专门从事支付服务的公司出现了。 |
| PayPal is the American firm we all recognise   today as the clear leader in online payments in Europe and the United States   (in Russia it’s Yandex. Money, and AliPay in China), but this wasn’t always   the case. This 2001 article on Bloomberg3 discussed PayPal’s potential   initial public offering (IPO): | 贝宝是我们今天公认的美国公司，在欧洲和美国，它显然是在线支付领域的领头羊(俄罗斯是扬德克斯钱包，中国是支付宝)。但情况并非总是如此。2001年刊登在彭博社的文章讨论了贝宝可以首次公开募股（IPO）的潜力： |
| In an Internet market starved for success   stories, PayPal (PAPXX) is one of the few upstarts brimming with potential.   Still, the Palo Alto (Calif.) company, which handles payments for buyers and   sellers on the sites of auctioneer eBay Inc.(EBAY) and other e-commerce   players, left the high-tech world agape when it filed paperwork on Sept. 28   for an $80 million initial public offering … earlier this year, PayPal   executives discussed selling to eBay, Citibank (C), and other companies, but   no one would approach PayPal’s asking price of more than $700 million,   according to analysts and investment bankers. | 在一个渴望获得成功故事的互联网市场中，贝宝是为数不多充满潜力的新兴企业之一。帕洛阿尔托（美国加州）公司（贝宝）在网上拍卖公司易趣和其他电子商务公司的网站上处理买家与卖家的交易。在9月28日提交了8000万美元的首次公开募股申请时，让高科技世界目瞪口呆。据分析师和投资银行家称，今年早些时候，贝宝高管讨论了向易趣，花旗银行和其他公司出售其产品，但没有一家公司接受贝宝超过7亿美元的要价。 |
| At the time, eBay had its own system called   Billpoint which had been developed in partnership with Wells Fargo.   Considered PayPal’s main rival, Billpoint processed around 25 per cent of all   online payments while PayPal processed 65 per cent. eBay then went on to   acquire PayPal in 2001. Interesting how times change. Valued at $700 million   in 2001, PayPal now has a market capitalisation of near $50 billion. It just   goes to show how important the payments system is to online commerce. | 当时，易趣公司拥有自己的系统，名为票点系统，与美国富国银行合作开发。这被认为是贝宝的主要竞争对手，票点系统处理了大约25％的在线支付，而贝宝处理了65％。易趣在2001年收购了贝宝。有趣的是时代在变。贝宝在2001年的市值为7亿美元，现在的市值接近500亿美元。这只是表明了支付系统对在线商务的重要性。 |

| Here’s a final thought on WEB 1.0. During this   time, banks launched their own online services and, eventually, offered   online banking. Most bank Websites were initially just brochures, and the   first online banking systems began around 1995 with Wells Fargo. I remember   these times quite well, as most banks believed they could shut branches and   shift all their customers   to online   banking, but it wasn’t that easy. Customers didn’t trust banking online and,   in many instances, the online banking services were pretty awful too. The   sites were just a transition from the branch-based ledger of debits and   credits to an online ledger of debits and credits, and it hasn’t changed much   since. | 下面是关于第一代互联网（WEB1.0）的最后一个想法。在此期间，银行推出了自己的在线服务，并最终提供网上银行服务。大多数银行网站最初的形式只是像小册子一样，第一个网上银行系统是始于1995年左右的富国银行。我很清楚地记得这些时刻，因为大多数银行认为他们可以关闭分行，把他们所有客户转移到网上银行，但这并不是那么容易。客户不信任网上银行，在许多情况下，网上银行服务也非常糟糕。这些网站只是从以分支机构为基础的借方和贷方分类账转换为在线借方和贷方分类账，并且从那以后就没怎么变化了。 |
| **WEB 2.0: THE SOCIAL NETWORK   BEGINS**                     | **WEB2.0****：社交网络的开端**                               |
| Following the emergence of e-commerce and a   plethora of payments services and commercial Websites by the end of the first   decade of the internet, not a great deal happened until the internet became   social. Blog platforms like WordPress and Typepad emerged in 2003, launched   in 2004 and YouTube came on board a year later. The era of the social WEB had   begun. | 到了互联网第一个十年的末期，随着电子商务、大量支付服务和商业网站的出现，在互联网变得社会化之前，（社会上）没有什么大的变化出现。像博客程序（WordPress）和博客（Typepad）这样的平台于2003年问世，脸谱网（Facebook）于2004年推出，油管（YouTube）在2005年推出。社交互联网的时代已经开始。 |
| In the mid-2000s, I had three key moments that   were awakenings around social networks. The first was at a beautiful   conference retreat on Lake Como, Italy, in 2006. I was the keynote alongside   various banking alumni, and talking as usual about the future of finance. One   of the senior management team of the host organisation got up to tell the   story of how his chief executive had been blindsided by the appearance of   YouTube a year earlier. The morning papers had appeared on his desk with the   headline “Google acquires YouTube for $1.65 billion”. As he had never heard   of this company, he called in his team and asked, “What is YouTube?” | 在二十一世纪第一个十年的中期，我经历了关于社交网络觉醒的三个关键时刻。第一次是2006年在意大利科莫湖举行的一次会议上。我和多位银行业的校友一起出席了会议，一起谈论金融业的未来。主办机构的一位高级管理人员讲述了他的首席执行官一年前因YouTube的出现而措手不及的故事。出现在他的办公桌上的早报，标题是“谷歌以16.5亿美元收购YouTube”。由于他从未听说过这家公司，他打电话给他的同事问：“YouTube是什么？” |
| None of them knew. So he typed in www.youtube.com   on his PC and the following message came back: “You are firewalled out of   this Website. Please contact the administrator if this is a problem.” It   certainly was a problem. This particular CEO ran a firm called McKinsey and   suddenly a revolution was bubbling under its feet and he was firewalled out.   The company has changed quite a bit since but, hey, that was then and this is   now. | 他们都不知道。于是，他在个人电脑上输入网址www.youtube.com，然后收到了以下信息：“你的网站被防火墙隔离了。如果有问题，请与管理员联系。”当然有问题。这位特别的首席执行官经营着一家名为麦肯锡的公司，突然之间，一场革命正在他的脚下滋生，他被防火墙挡住了。从那以后，该公司发生了很大的变化一直持续到现在。 |
| The second awakening was while I was running a   training programme with a University Corporate Education team for a large   global bank. A top futurist talked about the future of the world in the   morning, and I talked about the future of banks in the afternoon. This was   again back in 2006, and Facebook was just rising. | 第二次觉醒是我为一家大型全球性银行的大学企业教育团队做培训时。上午一位优秀的未来主义学者谈到了世界的未来，下午我谈到了银行的未来。这又回到了2006年，Facebook刚刚兴起的时候。 |
| At this time, I was hungrily joining everything   that was social, just out of pure interest. Facebook was a nice Website but   MySpace was rocking. After all, people were launching music careers in their   MySpace profiles. Meantime, Friends Reunited was doing pretty well, too. I therefore   included a social network discussion in my presentations, and would recount   how bad people were at using these new capabilities. By way of example, I   made up a story about how a senior manager at a bank had started using   Facebook, and was happily posting details of her life. There was no privacy   set on her profile, as people were not aware of privacy as a problem back   then. This meant that anybody could see her email and telephone number. They   could also see her husband, children, family and friends and where she hung   out at the weekend. This led to her being blackmailed into giving criminals   access to the bank after they kidnapped her children one Friday afternoon,   just before she was due to pick them up from school. | 在这个时候，我只是出于纯粹的兴趣而饥渴地加入了所有的社交活动。Facebook是一个不错的网站，但聚友网的发展不稳定。毕竟，聚友网的配置文件中推出了音乐板块。同时，老友重逢也做得很好。因此，我在我的演讲中加入了一个关于社交网络的讨论，并将详述人们在使用这些新功能方面有多么糟糕。我编造了一个故事来作为例子，讲的是一家银行的一位高级经理是如何开始使用Facebook的，Facebook是如何轻易地把她的生活细节公布了出来。她的个人资料上没有隐私设置，因为那时人们还没有意识到隐私是一个很重要的问题。这意味着任何人都可以看到她的电子邮件和电话号码。他们还可以了解到她的丈夫、孩子、家人和朋友的信息，以及她周末外出的地方。这导致了她被敲诈，在一个星期五的下午，她从学校将孩子接回银行后，罪犯进入银行绑架了她的孩子。 |
| I stopped telling this story in 2009 when my   fiction became reality, and the head of a call centre in one big bank lost   her life. It was too close to home but, again, it frustrated me that so many   people who attended these courses would come up to me at the end and say,   “Tell me more about Facebook and Twitter. I would love to use these   capabilities but spend the days at work firewalled out and I’m too busy at   the weekend doing other things.” These people didn’t know what was going on   in the internet world because they were firewalled out, again. | 在2009年，我的故事变成了现实，一家大银行呼叫中心的负责人失去了生命。从此我不再讲述这个故事。学校离我家很近，但是，最让我感到沮丧的是，很多参加这些课程的人最后都来问我，“告诉我更多关于脸书（Facebook）和推特（Twitter）的情况。我很乐意使用这些功能，但我每天的工作都被防火墙隔开，而我周末又忙于做其他的事情。”这些人不知道互联网世界里发生了什么，因为他们又一次被防火墙隔开了。 |
| The third realisation came from blogging. Now   I’ve been blogging every single day since 1 February 2007—over ten years   now—and that’s why I have a pretty good memory of my life, workwise. I’m   always blogging stories about how things are developing and changing. But   there was a specific moment that I remember with regard to banking and blogs.   It was 2007 and Wells Fargo chose to share their story of becoming social   online during a presentation that I was giving. The story focused on the   issue that when you did a Google search for “Wells Fargo”, the number one   search record that came back was a Website called WellsFargoSucks.com. Oh   dear. This was not the only spark for blogging, but it was one and having an   angry customer running an anti-bank Website galvanised the bank to launch a   blog and engage with customers online. | 第三次觉醒来自博客。从2007年2月1日起，我每天都在写博客——已经有十多年了——这就是为什么我对我的生活和工作方面有着很好的记忆。我总是写博客，讲述事物是如何发展和变化的。因此我记得有一个关于银行和博客的特殊时刻。那是2007年，富国银行让我在我的一次演讲中分享他们社交网站的故事。这个故事集中讨论的问题是，当你在谷歌搜索“富国银行”时，搜索结果第一条是一个名为WellsFargoSucks.com的网站。噢，亲爱的，这只是其中一个博客迸发出的火花。一位愤怒的客户管理着一个反银行网站，促使该银行推出了一个博客，并在网上与客户互动。 |
| My UK bank friends listening to this speech were   horrified that Wells Fargo launched a blog, as they could not imagine   engaging their customers socially online. “Weren’t you attacked with a lot of   hate?” they asked, prompted by the fact that they had tried an internal   social experiment that ended bloodily with employees sharing their gripes   more than anything else. | 我在英国银行的朋友们听了这篇演讲后对富国银行开通了一个博客感到震惊，因为他们无法想象如何在网上吸引客户。“难道你们的网站没有受到很多仇恨的攻击吗？”他们提出这个问题，是因为他们尝试了一项内部社会实验，结果惨败，员工们的抱怨比其他任何事情都多。 |
| “Sure,” said my friend Tim from Wells Fargo, “but   we overcame it by engaging in a conversation.” | “当然，”来自富国银行的朋友蒂姆说，“但我们通过谈话克服了这一困难。” |
| And that is the bottom line here: a conversation.   It’s just a conversation that has moved from the desk to the desktop to the   mobile app. Banks that ignored or were firewalled out of such conversations   know they are missing a trick, and it still amazes me how few banks leverage   social media well. For example, I just entered “bank blog” on Google and   found that start-ups like Starling and Atom appear in the first ten results, but   if I enter “Lloyds bank blog” or “Barclays bank blog”, there’s not much.   There’s a blog about Lloyds’ digital transformation and Barclays wealth   management has one, but both sites are very corporate and not particularly   social. And as for Twitter? Well, banks have relegated Twitter to a customer   service and public relations (PR) programme, and the rest doesn’t matter. | 这就是底线：谈话。这只是一个从桌面移动到移动应用程序的谈话。那些忽视或被排除在此类谈话之外的银行知道自己错过了一个机会，让我感到惊讶的是，很少有银行能很好地利用社交媒体。例如，我在谷歌上输入“银行博客”，发现像Starling银行和Atom银行这样的初创公司出现在前十个结果中，但如果我输入“英国劳埃德银行博客”或“巴克莱银行博客”，结果就不多了。劳埃德有一个关于其数字化转型的博客，巴克莱财富管理也有一个博客，但这两个博客都非常公司化，而不是特别社会化。至于推特？银行已经把推特降级为客户服务和公共关系(PR)项目，其余的都不重要了。 |
| It’s interesting as the best practices of   financial social networking are shown by banks in Turkey, where they provide   conversations through Facebook platforms, and in India, where ICICI bank goes   an extra mile to use Facebook as its bank platform rather than as a channel.   Equally, I still love the story of Fidor Bank using Facebook Likes to   determine its interest rates. | 有趣的是，土耳其和印度的银行都是金融社交网络的最佳实例。土耳其的银行通过脸书平台提供对话，印度工业信贷投资银行则进一步将脸书用作银行平台，而不仅仅只是作为一个渠道。同样，我仍然喜欢Fidor银行使用脸书来决定其利率的故事。 |
| Some banks truly understand the compelling power   of the social network, and that power is that it is customer created. People   create their networks. People create their content. People are living their   lives and recording their lives digitally. My decade of blogging and being   social is there forever. In fact, if Facebook or Twitter were to delete my   digital social history, I would sue them, as that’s my life, right there. And   my friends? I’ve never met many of my best friends. They might be psychos for   all I know but that is the beauty of the WEB 2.0 age. We have allowed   everyone to connect easily and create content without friction. Now I, like   the billions of other people on this planet with a mobile phone, continually   update my profile with shares, Likes, updates, video, photos and more. | 这些银行真正掌握了社交网络的强大力量，而这种力量是由客户创造的。人们创造出他们自己的关系网。人们创造出他们自己的内容。人们正以数字化的生活方式记录他们的生活。我十年的博客和社交记录永远存在。事实上，如果脸书或推特要删除我的数字社交历史，我会起诉他们，因为那是我的生活，就在那里。还有我的朋友们。我从来没见过我最好的朋友。我所认识的人，他们可能是精神变态者，但这就是WEB2.0时代的美丽之处。我们允许每个人轻松建立和产生联系并且不会产生摩擦。现在，像这个星球上有手机的亿万其他人一样，不断更新自己的个人资料，包括分享、喜好、最新状况、视频、照片等等。 |
| This is the internet age, and the big change in   WEB 2.0 was the movement from business to consumer. The consumer was put in   control. People now created content, and the strong control structures that businesses   had locked into WEB 1.0 were eradicated in WEB 2.0. Consumers are now media   channels with millions of followers. Bloggers, vloggers and podcast radio   shows are the new name of the game. People like PewDiePie rise from the   minions to become megastars, with millions of subscribers to their premium   YouTube channels, only to fall just as fast. But it wasn’t just the social   network that drove this change. It was the combination of mobile social. | 这是互联网时代，WEB2.0的重大变化是从商业到消费者的转变。消费者受到控制，人们现在创建了新内容，并且企业锁定在WEB1.0中的强大控制结构在WEB2.0中被根除了。消费者现在是拥有数百万粉丝的媒体渠道。博客、视频博客和播客电台节目是游戏的新名称。像PewDiePie（YouTube红人）这样的人从普通人变成了超级巨星，拥有数百万付费YouTube频道的订户，但却以同样的速度陨落。但是，推动这一变革的不只是社交网络，还有移动社交的结合。 |
| As the nascent industry emerged, so did the   smartphone with the launch of Apple’s first generation in 2007. Since then,   there are more phones than people on this planet and there will be more   smartphones than humans by 2021. I’m not going to go into a deep dive of the   mobile phenomena—I did that in my last book ValueWEB—except to underscore   that without it, there would be no social networking as we know it today. 24/7   in your pocket and bag is the transformation, and before the iPhone we mostly   used our Nokias and Blackberrys for email and telephone calls. Now we live   our lives through our phones. That has been the parallel innovation of WEB 2.0   which, interestingly, was almost missed by many including Mark Zuckerberg. In   2012, Facebook was so mobile-challenged that it had to warn investors   publicly via a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filing about its   weakness in the mobile market. | 随着新兴产业兴起，2007年苹果公司推出的第一代智能手机也是如此。从那时起，地球上的手机数量将超过人类的数量，到2021年，智能手机的数量也将如此。我不打算深入探讨手机现象——在我上一本书《价值网》已经提及过——只是强调，如果没有它，就不会有我们今天所知的社交网络。放在包或口袋里的东西一直处于转变的状态中，在iPhone发行之前，我们主要使用的是诺基亚和黑莓手机来收发邮件和打电话。现在我们通过手机生活。这是WEB2.0的另一个创新，有趣的是，包括马克•扎克伯格在内的许多人几乎错过了这一创新。2012年，脸书面临的移动挑战如此之大，以至于它不得不通过美国证券交易委员会(SEC)的一份文件公开警告投资者，脸书在移动市场的弱点。 |
| This near oversight was possible to overlook   because, until around 2012, it was easy to separate mobile and social; mobile   used the telephone carriers’ network whilst social was on the internet. Since   then, the two have converged thanks to 3G and its successors, 4G and soon 5G.   Many firms separated apps from their services, and didn’t see the rise of the   messenger, the chat room, the photo stream and the like. This is because the   leading social media firms of the time focused on online social rather than   mobile social. | 这种近乎疏忽的情况是可能被忽视的，因为直到2012年左右，移动电话和社交网络很容易就被分离；移动电话使用电话运营商的网络，而社交网络则发生在互联网上。从那时起，3G及其接班人4G和5G的迅速发展，让这两种技术已经融合在一起。许多公司将应用程序与他们的服务分开，所以并没有看到信使、聊天室、照片流等技术的兴起。这是因为当时领先的社交媒体公司专注于在线社交，而不是移动社交。 |
| The camera on the phone is a specific innovation   that made a huge difference in adoption, and today’s mobile smartphones carry   digital cameras that are a hundred times better than the high-end dedicated   digital cameras that were available a decade ago. That is why more photos are   taken in a day today than the total number printed in the last century. With   digital, it’s easy to take a hundred photos a day; in old money, that was   three Kodak films that would need to be taken to the lab, printed and picked   up a week later. | 手机摄像头是一项特殊的创新发明，它极大地改变了人们对手机的接受程度，如今的移动智能手机搭载的数码相机比十年前的高端专用数码相机要好100倍之多。这就是为什么今天一天拍摄的照片比上个世纪的照片总数还要多。有了数码，每天拍一百张照片是很容易的；在以前，三张柯达胶卷，送到影印室打印，需要一周后才能取走。 |
| So the WEB 2.0 age was a combination of factors   from mobile smartphones to phones with cameras to the mobile internet,   combined with social mobile apps. This naturally led to WEB 3.0, where   customers create their own value network structures. Who needs institutions   and governments to do this when we all live lives connected globally with   people we’ve never met? | 因此，WEB2.0时代是多种因素的结合，从移动智能手机到带摄像头的手机，再到移动互联网，以及社交移动应用程序。这自然导致了WEB3.0，客户创建了他们自己的价值网络结构。当我们都与从未见过的人生活在一起时，政府和机构的作用就不大了。 |
| **WEB 3.0: AN INTERNET OF   MARKETS**                        | **WEB3.0****：市场互联网**                                   |
| So, what exactly is WEB 3.0, the third-generation   internet? It’s not been well defined or described. Many would say it’s the   Internet of Things, but I disagree. The Internet of Things is emerging but it   cannot exist until a bridge between the mobile social network and the   Internet of Things has a strong underlying architecture for device-to-device   commerce. | 那么，第三代互联网（WEB3.0）到底是什么？关于它，没有很好地定义或描述。很多人会说它是物联网，但我不同意。物联网正在兴起，但它不可能已经成型，除非移动社交网络和物联网之间的桥梁具有强大的设备到设备商务的底层架构。 |
| I call that the Internet of Value, and it is   covered in depth in my book *ValueWeb*.   Consequently, I’m not going to go into great depth about the Internet of   Value here but, essentially, the Internet of Value discussion went along the   lines of building an underlying real-time and near-free value exchange   structure based on mobile internet and shared ledgers. I’ve changed my mind   about that since, in terms of how it’s positioned in WEB 3.0 as yes, you need   an Internet of Value for the Internet of Things but no, WEB 3.0 is not about   just the Internet of Value. The technologies discussed in ValueWeb are   important, and included my initial outline of the new business model of the   bank based on front-office apps linking through middle-office application   program interfaces (APIs) that are fed non-stop by intelligence from   back-office analytics engines using artificial intelligence and deep   learning. | 我称之为“价值互联网”，我的书《价值网》深入介绍了它。因此，我不打算在这里深入讨论价值互联网，但本质上，关于价值互联网的讨论是沿着建立一个基于移动互联网和共享账簿的实时、近乎免费的价值交换结构的思路进行的。我的想法已经改变，因为它在WEB3.0中的定位是肯定的，你需要物联网的价值互联网，但是，Web3.0不仅仅是价值互联网。价值互联网中讨论的技术非常重要，其中包括我最初的关于银行新业务模型的概述，该模型基于通过使用人工智能和深度学习后台分析引擎提供情报的中间办公室应用程序程序接口(APIs)连接前端应用程序。 |
| More recently, I’ve talked a lot about Open   Banking and open marketplaces. Open Banking is based on apps, APIs and   analytics, and offers access for everyone in an open marketplace. This is all   about moving us from vertically integrated control structures to a   marketplace of plug-and-play processes that are delivered through platforms.   Platforms where taxi firms own no taxis, hotel chains have no rooms and media   companies produce no content. The taxis, rooms and content are created by   those who play in your marketplace as you have become their preferred digital   platform. It is the people who need lifts that connect to the taxi drivers   registered on Uber. It is the people who need accommodation that connect to   the people offering rooms through Airbnb. It is the individuals who create   and share content on social media through Facebook and more. | 最近，我谈了很多关于开放银行和开放市场的话题。开放银行以应用程序、应用程序接口和分析为基础，为开放市场中的每个人提供访问权限。这就是将我们从垂直集成的控制结构转移到通过平台交付的即插即用过程的市场。出租车公司没有出租车，连锁酒店没有房间，媒体公司也不发布任何信息。出租车，房间和信息用于发挥市场作用，已经成为他们的首选数字平台。正是需要出租车的人与在优步登记的出租车司机建立了联系。正是那些需要住宿的人通过爱彼迎与那些提供客房的人建立了联系，是通过脸书等社交媒体上创建和分享信息的人。 |
| These marketplaces are the digital platforms for   the sharing economy and many of us have struggled to find a good banking example.   We have struggled because there isn’t one yet but Open Banking will get us to   move there. In fact, the nearest we get to an Open Bank today is Ant   Financial, which is one of several reasons why it is the in-depth case study   at the end of this book. | 这些市场是共享经济的数字平台，我们中的许多人一直在努力寻找一个好的银行业例子。我们一直在努力，因为还没有一个开放式银行可以让我们效仿。事实上，我们现在最接近开放银行的是蚂蚁金服，这也是为什么这本书最后会有深入的案例研究的原因之一。 |
| In an open marketplace, everyone can play. Banks   therefore are moving from proprietary structures that they control to open   platforms where everyone can play in their marketplace. That is a massive   cultural and structural change, not just the offering of an open API. Banks   have the opportunity to be better positioned to be the digital platform that   allows open marketplaces to operate. That is because they currently own the   customers’ accounts and have the size and capital to control the marketplace.   It does not mean they will succeed, as there are a lot of FinTech start-ups   also focused on building marketplace structures based on apps, APIs and   analytics. Such FinTech start-ups include Leveris, Thought Machine,   solarisBank, RailsBank, ClearBank and CBW Bank, to name just a few. | 在开放的市场中，每个人都可以操作。因此，银行正从它们控制的专有结构转向开放平台。在这种平台上，每个人都可以在其市场中发挥作用。这是一个巨大的文化和结构变化，而不仅仅是提供一个开放的应用编程接口。银行有机会更好地成为允许市场开放运营的数字平台。这是因为他们目前拥有客户的账户信息，并拥有控制市场的规模和资本。这并不意味着他们会成功，因为金融科技的许多初创公司也专注基于应用程序、应用程序接口和分析的市场架构建设。这类金融科技初创公司包括利韦里斯、思想机器、德国solaris银行、Rails银行、Clear银行和CBW银行等等。 |
| For banks to be players in such a marketplace,   they will have to open their historically closed systems to offer their APIs   for others to use. Equally, it means that they will most likely become a   curator and aggregator of other apps, APIs and analytics in order to give   their customers the best user experience. This is what Open Banking is all   about. | 银行要想在这样的市场中发挥作用，就必须开放历史上封闭的系统，提供应用程序接口给其他人使用。同样，这意味着他们很有可能成为其他应用程序、应用程序接口和分析的策展人和聚合者，以便为他们的客户提供最佳的用户体验。这就是开放式银行业务的全部。 |
| When you have an Open Bank, you can move really   fast. You can incorporate any other FinTech into the Open Bank and, just as   powerfully, you can connect the Open Bank into any other FinTech. The key to   the Open Bank vision is that everything can be connected from the Bank to   Business to Consumer structure. In other words, they can plug and play into   any FinTech, payments or other player. | 当你有一个开放的银行，你可以即时采取行动。你可以把任何其他金融科技纳入开放银行，同样有力的是，你可以将开放银行连接到任何其他金融科技。开放银行愿景的关键是，从银行到企业再到消费者结构，一切都可以连接起来。换句话说，他们可以加入任何金融科技、支付应用或其他设备。 |
| In doing so, and combining this with the themes   of rearchitecting the bank for open sourcing, I can see one particularly   powerful play—the Semantic Bank. The Semantic Bank has been alluded to for a   while, and already has some crude illustrations such as the BankAmericard   Rewards. Using Cardlytics, Bank of America can push you a reward coupon via   its app at the point of relevance, for instance, as you’re walking past one   of your regular shopping haunts. I’ll discuss this in more depth in the   chapter titled “The Rise of Robots”. | 通过这样做，并将其与重构开放源码银行的主题结合起来，我可以看到一个特别强大的角色——语义银行。语义银行已经被提及了一段时间，并且已经有了一些粗略的例子，比如“美洲银行卡的奖励”。使用Cardlytics，美国银行可以通过它的应用程序在相关点向您推送奖励优惠券，例如，当你走过一个常去的购物场所时。我将在“机器人的兴起”一章中深入地讨论这个问题。 |
| Other powerful capabilities have come into play   today, such as using AI to analyse terabytes of data non-stop in real time to   better serve customers. These analytics will then enable the bank to delve   deep into the psyche of its clients and use neural networks to proactively   predict their needs, provide advisory services and improve support   mechanisms. | 如今，其他强大的功能也在发挥作用，比如利用人工智能实时不间断地分析千兆字节的数据，以便更好地为客户服务。这些分析将使银行能够深入了解客户的心理，并利用神经网络主动预测他们的需求，提供咨询服务，并改进支持机制。 |
| These support mechanisms will be provided in   non-stop real time to my devices, which will tell me what is important and,   consequently, the devices can transact and manage what is not important. The   delivery of knowledge to my devices will sometimes be via the bank direct,   but often through third- party APIs that have plugged into my open-sourced   bank. As a result, my financial ecosystem will be greatly personalised at a   micro level, and I stop thinking about questions. Who would ever ask “What’s   my balance?” or say “Must remember to pay that bill”, now that my system has   taken over all of those tasks for me? All I would really need to know is “You   are low on your deposit balance” or “You should save more for that holiday   this month”, and I’d just say yes or no, depending on my mood and feeling.   This means that banking will move from a pull industry—where I have to go and   find my information and manage it—to a push industry—where my bank tells my   devices what to do. | 这些支持机制将不间断地实时提供信息给我的设备，这将告诉我什么是重要的，设备可以处理和管理什么是不重要的。将信息传递给我的设备有时会直接通过银行，但通常是通过第三方应用程序接口，这些应用程序接口已经接入了我的开源银行。因此，我的金融生态系统将在微观层面上被极大地个人化，以使我不再考虑其他问题。既然我的系统已经为我接管了所有这些任务，那谁还会问我“我的余额还有多少”或者“必须记得偿还账单。”我真正需要知道的是“你的存款余额不足”或“你应该为这个月的假期多存钱”，我只想说是或不是，这取决于我的心情和感觉。这意味着银行业将从一个具有吸引力的行业——在这个行业里我必须找到我的信息并对其进行管理——转变为一个推动型行业——在这个行业中，我的银行会告诉我的接受设备要做什么。 |
| I love the idea of the Open Bank and a financial   ecosystem personalised to my lifestyle and managed for me. The problem we   have today is that banks have only just got to the point where they can take   a debit and credit statement and plug it into a mobile app. An open-sourced   structure proactively pushing service to my IoT ecosystem is going to be a big   stretch. | 我喜欢开放银行和为我的生活方式个性化及为我管理的金融生态系统。我们今天面临的问题是，银行刚刚到了这样的地步：它们可以获取借方和贷方报表，并将其载入移动应用程序中。一个开源的结构，积极地推动服务到物联网生态系统，将是一个巨大的挑战。 |
| Some banks are proactively moving in this   direction though. A good example is BBVA and Santander, both of which have   not only been investing in FinTech start-ups but are also moving generally   towards partnering and including firms in their marketplace. BBVA has Holvi,   and Atom Bank whilst Santander is the leading European bank for investing in   start- ups. Santander has made thirteen investments into twelve unique   FinTech start-ups, including small business lender Kabbage. | 一些银行正在积极地朝着这个方向发展。西班牙对外银行和桑坦德银行就是一个很好的例子，这两家公司不仅一直在投资金融科技的初创企业，而且总体上也在向合作和将公司纳入市场的方向发展。西班牙对外银行投资了Holvi银行、Simple银行和Atom银行，桑坦德银行则是投资初创企业的欧洲领先银行。桑坦德银行已经对12家独特的金融科技初创企业进行了13项投资，其中包括小型企业贷款机构卡布奇。 |
| What we are seeing, therefore, is banks curating   their marketplaces and choosing the cream of the FinTech crop to offer their   customers a better user experience and service. After all, is your average   Joe or Mary going to test a thousand start-up products and find the cream of   the FinTech crop? Probably not, which is the real opportunity here for the collaborative   Open Bank. After all, the collaborative Open Bank recognises that it controls   nothing, can only build some decent functionality and needs lots of other   players to play on its platform if it is going to be able to offer choice to   its customers. So, an Open Bank offers its customers this choice but also   offers to aggregate such services on the customers’ behalf. After all, when   faced with a thousand different P2P services, which one do I choose? Why   choose at all? Let the Open Bank do it for you. | 因此，我们看到的是银行管理他们的市场，并选择金融科技中的精英产品，为他们的客户提供更好的用户体验和服务。毕竟，你作为一个普通人难道会像乔或玛丽一样去测试一千种新产品，并找到金融科技中的精英产品吗？也许不会，但这才是合作开放银行的真正机会。毕竟，合作开放银行认识到，它什么也控制不了，只能构建一些像样的功能，如果它想要为客户提供选择，就需要大量其他参与者在其平台上发挥作用。因此，开放银行为其客户提供了这一选择，但也提供了以客户的名义汇总此类服务的机会。毕竟，面对一千个不同的P2P点对点服务，我应该选择哪一个呢？为什么选择呢？让开放银行为您服务。 |
| That’s the beauty of a marketplace. Do you choose   the Facebook content you read or the Uber taxi driver you want, or let   Airbnb, Facebook or Uber do if for you? It depends how much time and interest   you have. The same applies with banking. | 这就是市场的美妙之处。你是想自主选择你看过的脸书内容，你想要的优步出租车司机，还是让爱彼迎、脸书或优步帮你选择？这取决于你有多少时间和兴趣。这同样适用于银行业务。 |

| So what is the business model of an Open Bank?   What exactly does it look like? This is probably the most important question   tackled in this book, and the diagrams that follow are ones that I will refer   to often, so please take note. | 那么开放银行的商业模式是什么？它到底是什么样的？这可能是本书中讨论的最重要的问题，下面的图表是我经常参考的，所以请注意。 |
| I’ve been working on this model for a while, and   the diagram below shows the bank structure based on a back office   manufacturing products and services, a middle office processing transactions   and payments and a front office retailing intimacy and experiences. | 我已经使用该模型工作了一段时间，下面的图表显示了基于后台办公室制造产品和服务、中间办公室处理交易和支付以及前台零售的亲密感和体验的银行结构。 |

| My assertion is that in the old, industrial era   bank, all of this front-, middle- and back-office structure was proprietary   and internalised and now has to move to open and externalised. This is   because smart devices are where the relationships are developed in the front   office. Plug-and-play software across the operations allow anyone to offer   code through APIs to improve the middle office link between front and back   office, and those APIs and apps are fed through data leverage based on   machine learning and artificial intelligence through the cloud. | 我的主张是，在旧的工业化时代的银行中，所有的前、中、后系统结构都是专有的、内部化的，现在必须走向开放和外部化。这是因为智能设备是前台系统建立关系的地方。跨操作的即插即用软件允许任何人通过应用程序接口提供代码，以改善前台和后台系统之间的中台系统的连接，而这些应用程序接口和应用程序则由基于机器学习的数据杠杆和云端人工智能提供。 |
| As a result, the back office is all about   analytics, the middle office about APIs and the front office is smart apps   for smart devices. | 因此，后台系统完全是关于分析的，中台系统是关于应用程序接口的，前台系统是智能设备的智能应用程序。 |
| BACK OFFICE MIDDLE OFFICE FRONT OFFICE                       | 后台系统中台系统前台系统                                     |

| We are already entering the fourth-generation   internet, the Internet of Things, but it won’t really take off until the 2020s.   Sure, we have self-driving Teslas and Nest home appliances, along with   Samsung’s SmartThings, but none of it is mainstream yet. | 我们已经进入第四代互联网——物联网，但直到21世纪20年代它才真正腾飞。当然，我们有自动驾驶的特斯拉和巢家用电器，还有三星的智能终端，但它们都还不是主流产品。 |
| This will change though, and it’s not just   devices on the internet, but a whole raft of technologies from robotics to   artificial intelligence to machine learning, combined with IoT, that will   make it happen. These technologies are already playing into every aspect of   our lives, from street lighting to gene editing, and are transforming our   world into a connected smart structure. The idea is that you can place a chip   inside anything and make it smart. Smart roads, smart buildings, smart   cities, smarter people. In the next decade of the internet, a number of key   developments will come into play to start building the Semantic WEB, or WEB 5.0. | 但这将改变，不仅仅是互联网上的设备，而是从机器人到人工智能再到机器学习，再到物联网的一系列技术，这些都将使它成为现实。这些技术已经渗透到我们生活的各个方面，从路灯到基因编辑，并正在把我们的世界变成一个连接的智能结构。这个想法是，你可以把一个芯片植入任何东西，并使其智能化。智能道路，智能建筑，智能城市，更聪明的人。在互联网的下一个十年中，将有许多关键发展将开始构建语义互联网，即WEB5.0。 |
| In other words, whether we consciously know it or   not, we are building a smart planet where everyone and everything will be   connected and communicating non-stop. How many things will be connected in   this future planet? There are various estimates. For instance, research house   IHS Markit estimate 78 billion things communicating by 2025. | 换句话说，无论我们是否主动地去意识到这一点，我们都在建设一个智能星球，在这个星球上，每一个人和每一件事都将被连接起来，并且不间断地进行交流。在这个星球上，未来会有多少东西会被连接起来？有各种估计。例如，研究机构环球透视服务器估计，到2025年，通信业务量将达到780亿件。 |

| And, if you like that sort of thing, Forbes does   an annual roundup of what the research firms are thinking about IoT,   including headline grabbers like: | 如果你喜欢这类事情，《福布斯》每年都会对研究公司对物联网的看法进行综述，其中包括一些抢占头版头条的人，比如： |
| Bain predicts that by 2020 annual revenues could   exceed $470 billion for the IoT vendors selling the hardware, software and   comprehensive solutions. | 贝恩咨询公司预计，到2020年，出售硬件、软件和综合解决方案的物联网供应商的年收入将超过4700亿美元。 |
| General Electric predicts investment in the   Industrial Internet of Things (IoT) is expected to top $60 trillion during   the next 15 years. | 通用电气预计，未来15年对工业物联网的投资将超过60万亿美元。   |
| This is big.                                                 | 这是一个很大的数据。                                         |
| In my own mind, I’m  just thinking that I’ll have a TV,  a car, a fridge,  a heating system, a desktop or tablet or   both, a mobile, a watch, a health monitor possibly swallowed and inside me, a   robot to look after the house, a security system, a dog, children and an   automated personal assistant all on the net. That’s fifteen things on the net   just for me. Then my wife and kids will have a few things, probably at least   five each. So, in a typical household in a developed economy, there will be   an average of thirty things on the internet. | 在我看来，我只是希望我会有一台电视，一辆汽车，一台冰箱，一个取暖系统，一个台式机或平板电脑或两者兼而有之，一部手机，一块手表，一台健康监视器，一个照看房子的机器人、一个安全系统、一只狗、一个孩子和一个自动化的个人助理。所有这些都被我写在了网上。这只是我写在网上的十五件事。然后，我的妻子和孩子也会有一些想要的东西，可能每个人至少有五件。因此，在一个发达的经济体里，一个典型的家庭，将平均有三十件东西是与互联网相关的。 |
| Bearing in mind we live in a developed economy,   there will be smart governments that will roll out a further average five   things on the net per person, for instance, security monitors, car sensors on   the roads, automated toll systems, tracking services and the like. My   household of four people will add another twenty things to the internet,   thanks to the government. So, we’re looking at a minimum of ten things per   person in a developed economy online. | 考虑到我们生活在一个发达的经济体中，明智的政府在网上将推出平均每人再多5件东西，例如安全监视器、道路上的汽车传感器、自动收费系统、跟踪服务等等。感谢政府，我的四口之家将在互联网上增加另外二十件东西。所以，在一个发达的经济体中，我们能看到每个人至少十件东西。 |
| In developing economies and in countries where   some of society are excluded or have less inclusion, there will still be a   lot of things on the internet supporting them. Definitely a mobile device,   but equally government monitoring systems and smarter infrastructure. For the   purposes of this book, I am going to be conservative and estimate that   two-thirds of Earth’s population, which will have risen to eight billion   people by 2025, will be using multiple devices on the network. Building on   this, we then have  the United Nations’   aim to increase inclusion by that time—it is one of  its sustainable goals—and we could assume   that only half the planet will be living in poorer conditions, compared to   two-thirds today. That means you have four billion people with an average of   five things on the internet monitoring their activities, and four billion   with ten things, of which five are for their lifestyle and five are for the   government. | 在发展中的经济体和社会中一些人被排斥或包容性较低的国家，互联网上仍会有很多东西可以供他们使用。那就是移动设备，但同样也是政府监控系统和更智能的基础设施。出于本书的目的，我将保守地估计现在有三分之二的地球人口，到2025年将增加到80亿人，将使用网络上更多设备。在此基础上，联合国将在那时增加包容性这一目标——可持续目标之一——我们可以假设地球上只有一半的人会生活在贫困的环境中，而今天却有三分之二。这意味着有40亿人在互联网上平均有5件事监控他们的活动，有40亿人有10件事，其中5件是他们的生活方式，5件是政府的。 |
| That’s a minimum of sixty billion things on the   internet, and these things are communicating non-stop. The fact that they are   communicating means that they have intel inside, and that means they can   transact. If sixty billion things are trading and transacting non-stop, 24/7,   you’re talking trillions of transactions. It wouldn’t surprise me if there   were billions of things transacting trillions of times a minute in very small   amounts, all day long. | 这至少有600亿件互联网上的东西，这些东西在不停地交流。事实上，他们正在沟通，意味着他们有内部的情报也意味着他们可以进行交易。如果600亿的东西全天候在不停地交易，则是数以万亿计的交易。如果每天都有几十亿的东西以很小的数量在一分钟内处理数万亿次的事情，我也不会感到惊讶。 |
| *What is the financial   system that will support that structure of operation and how will it know   what things are allowed to transact with which?* | 支持这种运作结构的金融体系是什么？它如何知道允许哪些事物相互之间进行交易？ |
| You can find the detailed answer in ValueWeb.   However, this does raise two crucial questions. First, how are machines   authorised to trade on behalf of humans? Second, when do the machines need to   be kept in check? For example, if my fridge orders twelve bottles of white   wine when it usually orders six, is that a mistake? Should it be verified?   And how often does the human want to verify what their fridge, or TV, car,   house, etc., is doing? Equally, how does the bank know that the fridge, or   TV, car, house, etc., belongs to that human, and what they’ve authorised it   to do? | 您可以在《价值网》中找到详细的答案。然而，这确实提出了两个关键问题。首先，机器如何被授权代表人类进行交易？第二，何时需要对机器进行检查？例如，如果我的冰箱设置的程序是点十二瓶白葡萄酒，而平时它却点了六瓶，这是一个错误吗？应该验证吗？人们多久会想要验证他们的冰箱，电视，汽车，房屋等等在做什么？同样，银行怎么知道冰箱、电视、汽车、房子等属于那个人，他们授权它做什么？ |
| This is something that leads us naturally to a   discussion on digital identity … or does it? To be honest, the more I think   about my Internet of Things, the more I think that my things will be wrapped   up in a mobile wallet. This is why the Alipay (China), Paytm (India), Vipps   (Norway) and Venmo/PayPal (USA) wallets become so key because these wallets   can wrap a range of things inside, and aggregate the payments they need to   make. | 这自然使我们对数字身份进行了讨论，是真的吗？说实话，我对物联网的看法越多，我就越认为我的东西将被装在手机钱包里。这就是为什么支付宝(中国)、Paytm(印度)、VIPPS(挪威)和Venmo/PayPal(美国)支付钱包变得如此关键的原因，因为这些钱包可以把一系列东西装在里面，并将它们需要支付的款项汇总起来。 |
| This is the real underlying play by Apple Pay.   After all, I have my mobile (iPhone), watch (Apple), TV (Apple TV), car (soon   to be a self-driving Apple car) and more. They are all in my Apple account   for which they Apple Pay. So what if I were to ask the following question:   When you have billions of devices transacting trillions of times a minute in   very small amounts, what is the financial system that you’ll use to support   it? | 这才是苹果支付真正的潜在作用。毕竟，我有手机(iphone)、手表(苹果)、电视(苹果电视)、汽车(即将成为苹果自动驾驶汽车)等等。它们都在苹果支付的苹果账户中。那么如果我问下面这个问题：当你有数十亿台设备每分钟以非常小的数量处理数万亿次的交易时，你将使用什么样的金融系统来支持它呢？ |
| Stop and think about it. It doesn’t have to be   blockchain, machine learning, data analytics and cloud—although in the back   office, these technologies will create new and dynamic efficiencies. However,   if you really want to take away the friction of transacting, then the device   aggregators will win, and those device aggregators are already out there   doing their thing. By aggregating devices, you can aggregate their   transactions and, thereby, allow trillions of transactions amongst billions   of devices non-stop, and then bill monthly. | 停下来思考一下。不一定非得是区块链、机器学习、数据分析和云——尽管在后台，这些技术将创造新的动态效率。然而，如果你真的想消除交易的摩擦，那么设备聚合器就会获胜，而那些设备聚合器已经在做他们的事情了。通过聚合设备，您可以聚合他们的交易，从而在数十亿设备中不间断地允许数万亿次交易，然后按月结算。 |
| It’s such a great yet unrecognised idea that when   we do wake up to what these guys are doing, we’re going to go wow, just wow. | 当我们真正意识到这些家伙在做什么的时候，我们会觉得哇哦，这是一个伟大的但还没有被认可的想法。 |

| Take this line from the 2013 film Her, “It’s not   just an operating system, it’s a consciousness.” The film is about Theodore,   played by Joaquin Phoenix. Theodore is a lonely writer who gets to trial OS1,   the world’s first artificially intelligent operating system. OS1 tailors   itself to the individual’s habits and needs, and is almost alive, as   represented by the personality of its voice, Samantha, played by Scarlett   Johansson. From IMDb: | 就拿2013年的电影《她》来说吧，“这不仅仅是一个操作系统，它更是一种意识。”这部电影关于西奥多，由杰昆·菲尼克斯扮演。西奥多是一个孤独的作家，他试用了OS1，这是世界上第一个人工智能操作系统。OS1根据人的习惯和需要量身定做，几乎是活生生的，由斯嘉丽·约翰逊扮演的萨曼莎的声音就代表了这一点。来自互联网电影数据库： |
| Theodore quickly finds himself drawn in with   Samantha, the voice behind his OS1. As they start spending time together they   grow closer and closer and eventually find themselves in love. Having fallen   in love with his OS, Theodore finds himself dealing with feelings of both   great joy and doubt. As an OS, Samantha has powerful intelligence that she   uses to help Theodore in ways others hadn’t, but how does she help him deal   with his inner conflict of being in love with an OS? | 西奥多很快发现自己被萨曼莎吸引了，萨曼莎是OS1发出的声音。他们长时间在一起时，他们变得越来越亲近，最终西奥多发现自己陷入了爱河。在爱上了这个操作系统后，西奥多发现他自己处于巨大的喜悦和怀疑的感觉中。作为一个操作系统，萨曼莎拥有强大的智慧，她用其他人没有的方式来帮助西奥多，但她如何帮助西奥多处理他爱上操作系统的内心冲突？ |
| Sound silly? Not really. Samantha is likely to   appear some time in the next decade and, by the 2030s, will be   superintelligent. There are actually three levels of artificial intelligence: | 听起来很傻？也不完全是。萨曼莎可能在未来十年出现一段时间，到21世纪30年代，将是超级智能。实际上有三个级别的人工智能： |
| Artificial narrow intelligence (ANI): AI that   specialises in one area, such as an AI that can beat the world chess champion   in chess, but that’s the only thing it does | 弱人工智能（ANI）：专门研究某一领域的人工智能，比如能在国际象棋中击败世界国际象棋冠军的人工智能，但这是它唯一能做的事情。 |
| Artificial general intelligence (AGI): AI that   reaches and then passes the intelligence level of a human, meaning it can   “reason, plan, solve problems, think abstractly, comprehend complex ideas,   learn quickly and learn from experience”. This level beats the Turing Test in   which scientists are unable to tell the difference between the machine and   the human. | 强人工智能（AGI）：达到并通过人类智力水平的人工智能，意味着它可以“推理、计划、解决问题、抽象地思考、理解复杂的想法、快速学习和从经验中学习”。这一水平超过了图灵测试，在图灵测试中，科学家们无法分辨出机器和人类之间的区别。 |
| Artificial super intelligence (ASI): AI that   achieves a level of intelligence smarter than all of humanity combined,   “ranging from just a little smarter … to one trillion times smarter”. This is   the era where the machines run the planet and learn from each other,   vis-à-vis Skynet in the Terminator films. | 人工超级智能（ASI）：人工智能达到比所有人类智能加起来更聪明的水平，“从一点点，更聪明的…到一万亿倍的智能”。在《终结者》电影中，这是一个机器运行地球并相互学习的时代。 |
| Intriguingly, in most science-fiction movies, the   future is portrayed as scary and dark, as in The Terminator and Ex Machina,   but it is far more nuanced than that. I often look back at history for   examples of the future, and see things like the invention of Coca-Cola to   relieve people of the fear of fast cycle change: | 有趣的是，在大多数科幻电影中，未来被描绘成恐怖和黑暗，就像《终结者》和《机械姬》一样，但它的细节要微妙得多。我经常回顾历史，寻找未来的例子，看到可口可乐的发明，以减轻人们对周期快速变化的恐惧： |
| 1886: Coca-Cola is invented by Colonel John   Pemberton, who has been injured in the American civil war and developed an   addiction to morphine. He decides to invent a tonic to cure him of his habit   and comes up with a coca wine – which uses coca leaves (the basis of cocaine)   and kola nuts (a source of caffeine) – to cure him. Eventually, Coca-Cola   becomes widely available, sold as a medicine at soda fountains across the US,   with Pemberton claiming it could cure ailments including impotence, headaches   and dyspepsia.4 | 1886年：可口可乐是约翰·彭伯顿上校发明的，他在美国内战中受伤，对吗啡上瘾。他决定发明一种补品来治疗他的上瘾，并研制出一种古柯酒——用古柯叶(可卡因的基础)和科拉坚果(咖啡因的一种来源)来治愈他。最终，可口可乐被广泛销售，作为一种药品在美国各地销售，彭伯顿声称它可以治疗包括阳痿、头痛和消化不良在内的疾病。 |
| Back in the late 1800s and early 1900s, the fast   movement of technology from railways to manufacturing to the appearance of   aeroplanes and moving pictures meant that the Victorians and Edwardians   greatly feared what was in store for the future. After all, this was the era   of H.G.Wells telling stories of alien invasions in War of the Worlds and the   chilling story of The Machine Stops by E.M. Forster. If you haven’t read the   latter, I recommend you do. Here’s a short synopsis: | 早在19世纪末和20世纪初，科技从铁路到制造业的快速发展，再到飞机和电影的出现，意味着维多利亚时代和爱德华时代的人非常害怕未来会发生什么。毕竟，这是赫伯特·乔治·威尔斯在《星际战争》中讲述外星人入侵的故事，以及E·M·福斯特《机器休止》的令人毛骨悚然的故事的时代。如果您还没有阅读过后者，我建议您阅读。下面是关于《机器休止》的故事梗概： |
| In a future world, humans live in isolation below   ground due to some form of toxic event poisoning the air of Earth. The   Machine is a kind of Skype service by which people conduct their only   activity, sharing ideas and knowledge. The two main characters, Vashti and   her son 4See “128 years of Coca-Cola and its many brand extensions,”   Campaign, June 2014. Kuno, live on opposite sides of the world. Kuno tells Vashti   that he has visited the surface of Earth without permission, and without the   life support apparatus that is supposedly required to survive in the toxic   air, and he saw other humans living outside the world of the Machine.   However, the Machine has recaptured him and he has been threatened with   “Homelessness”, that is, expulsion from the underground environment and sent   to the surface of Earth, meaning death by exposure to the outside air. | 在未来的世界里，由于某种形式的有毒事件毒害了地球的空气，人类在地下与世隔绝地生活着。有种机器是用于网络电话（Skype）服务，人们通过它进行唯一的活动，分享想法和知识。瓦实提和她的儿子是故事中的两个主角。4参见“可口可乐128周年及其众多品牌延伸”活动，2014年6月。库诺，生活在世界的另一边。库诺告诉瓦实提，他在未经许可的情况下去到了地面，而且没有带有毒空气中生存所需的生命支持装置，他看到了生活在机器控制世界之外的其他人。然而，机器再次抓住了他，他受到“无家可归”的威胁，从地下环境中被驱逐到地面，这意味着将暴露在地表的有毒空气中然后死去。 |
| As time passes, two things happen. First, the   life support apparatus, required to visit the world above ground, is   abolished. Second, a kind of religion is established in which the Machine is   the object of worship. People forget that humans created the Machine, and   treat it as a mystical entity whose needs supersede their own. Those who do   not accept the deity of the Machine are threatened with Homelessness. Due to   humans giving into the Machine, they worship it without further thought, and   without maintenance. | 随着时间的推移，会发生两件事。第一，   夺去地面世界所需的生命支持设备。第二，建立一种以机器为崇拜对象的宗教。人们忘记了机器是由人类创造的，然后将其视为一个要取代自己的神秘实体。那些不接受机器神性的人受到无家可归的威胁。由于人类依靠机器，他们不经过进一步思考就崇拜它。 |
| I won’t say any more except to reiterate the   title in the context of having read the above: what happens if the Machine   stops? | 我不想再多说了，只是在阅读了上面的内容之后，重申了标题：如果机器停止，会发生什么？ |
| You see? Scary is the future, is it not?                     | 你看到了吗？未来是可怕的，不是吗？                           |
| And yet, when we look back in hindsight, the past   is not scary at all. In fact, it seems primitive. What did we do before we   had cars? Who lived a life without a mobile phone? What would we do without   the Facebook Machine? | 然而，当我们回首往事时，过去一点也不可怕。事实上，它看起来很原始。我们在有车之前做了什么？谁过着没有手机的生活？没有脸书我们该怎么办？ |
| So, when I look ahead to see what the internet   will look like in twenty years, I cannot be certain but, what is clear, is   that it will be a consciousness. It will be all around us, running   everything,  and  with    super  intelligence built into   robots that look like humans and humans who live with robotics inside them. | 所以，当我展望未来20年互联网会是什么样子的时候，我不能确定，但是，很清楚的是，它将是一种意识。它将围绕在我们周围，运行着所有的东西，并将超级智能内置在机器人中，这些机器人看上去就像人类，而人类生活在机器人的内部。 |
| Some call this the Semantic WEB, and it has been   forecast for years. The phrase “Semantic WEB” was coined by Tim Berners-Lee   back in 2001 in an article published by the Scientific American, co-authored   with James Hendler and Ora Lassila. They defined it as an internet that “will   enable machines to comprehend semantic documents and data, not human speech   and writings”. | 有人称其为语义网，而且它已经被预测了很多年。“语义网”一词是由蒂姆•伯纳斯•李于2001年从由詹姆斯·亨德和奥拉·拉斯莱共同撰写的发表于《美国科学杂志》的一篇文章中提取出来的。他们将互联网定义为“将使机器能够理解语义文档和数据，而不是人类的语言和文字”。 |
| Since then, it has become a bucket used by many   to describe the WEB when it wakes up. When the internet is ubiquitous and   conscious. Whatever you want to call it, by the 2030s, it is pretty obvious   that we will have a networked planet with devices intelligently trading on   that network. Where robots have intelligence as good as or, in many cases,   better than humans. Where we are travelling as space tourists and where the   most likely skills will be creativity and science rather than trading and   retail. We will still need to eat and drink, be entertained and operated on   but as so many of these needs will be serviced by machines, we will live   lives that are much improved in comparison with those who have lived before.   It is far more likely that by this period, we will have automated most menial   tasks as well as many of those that currently require cognitive skills, such   as brokers and traders. | 从那时起，当使用互联网的时候，许多人都用它来描述网络。当互联网无处不在且有意识的时候。无论你怎么称呼它，到21世纪30年代，很明显，我们将有一个网络化的星球，在网络上有智能交易设备。机器人的智力和人类一样高，在很多情况下，甚至比人类更高。我们作为游客旅行太空的地方，最有可能的技能是创造力和科学，而不是贸易和零售。我们仍然需要吃喝、娱乐和运行，但由于许多这些需求将由机器提供服务足，我们的生活相比以前有很大的改善。更有可能的是，到这个时期，我们将自动完成大多数琐碎的任务，以及许多目前需要认知技能的任务，如经纪人和交易员。 |
| What will we be doing? Well, I’ve already tried   to answer some of those questions in the opening chapter: repairing robots,   creating next-generation systems, curing the world’s ills and servicing our   spacecraft. It all sounds like science fiction but, as I so often repeat, a   lot of science fiction becomes science fact. In fact, the reason why   Victorians wrote scary books about a future dystopia is the same reason why   we make scary movies about a future dystopia today. Because it sells. It   sells because people are frightened of change, and the future is always   changing. | 我们要做什么？在第一章中，我已经试着回答了其中的一些问题：修理机器人，创造下一代系统，治愈世界的弊病，以及维修我们的宇宙飞船。这一切听起来像科幻小说，但正如我经常重复的，很多科幻小说变成了科学事实。事实上，维多利亚时代人们写有关未来反乌托邦的恐怖书籍的原因，和我们制作关于未来反乌托邦的恐怖电影的原因是一样的。因为它很畅销。它之所以畅销，是因为人们害怕变化，然而未来总是在变化。 |
